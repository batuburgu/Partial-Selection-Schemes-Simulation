# Partial Selection Schemes Simulation for CAF Relaying

This repository provides MATLAB scripts to simulate and analyze the **Bit Error Rate (BER)** and **Symbol Error Rate (SER)** performance of partial selection schemes in **Cooperative Amplify-and-Forward (CAF)** relaying systems. Both analytical and simulation-based results are included.

## üìÅ File Structure

- `partial_selection_schemes.m`:  
  Simulates BER and SER curves for different partial selection schemes in CAF relaying scenarios for BPSK modulation.

- `qam_selection_af.m`:  
  Provides analytical derivations and simulations for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) modulation for "All Participate Amplify Forward (AP-AF)" and "Selection Amplify Forward (S-AF)".
